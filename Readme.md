<h3>My Process</h3>
⪼I started by writing down the markup using HTML5 language. Then using CSS3 properties and Bootstrap, desktop design was created.

⪼I have created a Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ) accordion using JavaScript. The accordion is used to display the content in list format. It can expand or collapse to display the content it contains.

⪼ After that using dev chrome tools the card was made responsive.
